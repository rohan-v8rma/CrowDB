# Basic stuff

## Definition part

- A Hash Table in C/C++ (Associative array) is a data structure that maps keys to values. This uses a hash function to compute indexes for a key.
Based on the Hash Table index, we can store the value at the appropriate location.

- If two different keys get the same index, we need to use other data structures (buckets) to account for these collisions.

- The whole benefit of using a Hash Table is due to itâ€™s very fast access time. While there can be a collision, if we choose a very good hash function, this chance is almost zero.
So, on average, the `time complexity is a constant O(1)` access time. This is called Amortized Time Complexity.

- Any Hash Table implementation has the following three components:

  - A good Hash function to map keys to values
  - A Hash Table Data Structure that supports insert, search and delete operations.
  - A Data Structure to account for collision of keys
